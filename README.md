# INSTACART-PYTHON
A data analysis project using PYTHON to analyze data from an online Grocery Basket, Instacart.

About:

Objective:
 Instacart is an online grocery store. that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Our task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
 
Context:
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products

The project took nearly 7 weeks from May 2023 to the end of June 2023, and it was finished on time.

Credits:

My role as a data analyst was to analyze the Instacart data set to inform the stakeholders if Instacart targeted the right customer with the appropriate products. To be able to achieve this I started with organizing and checking the data, I analyzed the data set and finally I interpreted the results of my analysis and offered recommendations to the stakeholders from Instacart.

Tools:
Python and Excel
 
Methodologies:
I used statistical methods with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Scipy libraries.
